## Compiling and running the shell
#### Linux
Run `compile` as bash in the terminal:
```sh
bash compile
```
this will generate an executable in bin folder, run it:
```sh
./bin/bf
```
#### Windows
First make sure you have g++ installed (Command Prompt will not recognize the `g++` command if you dont) and run the following commands:
```bat
mkdir bin
g++ -g shell/main.cc -o bin/bf -O3 -s -Wall -std=c++17;
```
then run it:
```bat
bin/bf
```
